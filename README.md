# Vietjet Crawler using Python Selenium

This is a Python script for crawling flight information from the Vietjet website using the Selenium library. The script automates the process of extracting flight details such as departure time, arrival time, and ticket prices.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library (`pip install selenium`)
- Chrome web browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome browser version)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook `vietjet_crawler.ipynb`.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ````
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ````

3. Sit back and relax while the script automates the process of navigating to the Vietjet website, searching for flights, and extracting the flight details. The results will be displayed in the console and saved in a CSV file named `flight_details.csv`.

## Notes

- Please ensure that you use this script responsibly and in compliance with the Vietjet website's terms of service.

- The script is built using Selenium, which controls the Chrome browser. By default, it uses the ChromeDriver executable placed in the same directory. Make sure to update the ChromeDriver version if you encounter any compatibility issues.

- You can customize the script further to extract additional flight information or implement other functionalities based on your requirements.
